1. Use JavaScript's fetch functionality to grab data from an external web resource. The data must be in either JSON or XML format.

2. During the data processing stage of your application, demonstrate competence with JavaScript array methods.

3. Demonstrate that you understand the DOM and the DOM API. Either data retrieved from the web or statistics derived from that data must be presented in a web page by using the DOM API. You may use jQuery or another suitable library rather than the raw DOM API.

4. Include CSS in your application and that CSS must originate as SASS and be processed into raw CSS. For details on installing a sass processor, see here: https://sunlightmedia.org/using-node-sass-to-compile-sass-files-in-an-npm-script/

5. Leverage at least 1 other third party JavaScript library. A good source of libraries is : http://microjs.com.
